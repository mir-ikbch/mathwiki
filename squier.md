# String Rewriting Systems and Squier's Homological Methods

Craig Squier showed that there exists a finitely presented monoid with solvable word problem that does not have any finite terminating Church-Rosser presentation.

He showed that if a monoid \\(S\\) has a finite terminating Church-Rosser presentation, then the monoid \\(S\\) is FP3, i.e., the left-\\(\mathbb{Z}S\\) module \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) has a free resolution
$$ C_3 \to C_2 \to C_1 \to C_0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0 $$
with finitely generated \\(C_i\\)s.

Thus, if a monoid is not FP3, then it does not have a finite terminating Church-Rosser presentation.


Kobayashi showed that having a finite terminating Church-Rosser presentation implies the monoid is in fact FP\\(\inf\\).
